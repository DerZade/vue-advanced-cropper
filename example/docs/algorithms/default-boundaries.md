Algorithms are in the intensive development. It's the draft of their description and you shouldn't rely on it right now.

This algorithm is used to init **boundaries**. It's the special element that serves as an area for displaying of **visible area** and **stencil**.

In this library there are two standard algorithms: `fit` (default) and `fill` . If you pass that strings to `default-boundaries` the corresponding algorithm will be used.
