# Showcase

::: tip Hey!
If you've encountered the cropper on the Web that can't be implemented with this library, feel free to [write me](mailto:norserium@gmail.com) about it.
:::

At this page you can find the examples of reimplementing existing croppers from real sites. The example
may use undocumented or unreleased features, so it's just the demonstration of the library might, not the 
guide.

## Twitter

This example uses undocumented features, so be careful: the behavior may be changed in the future. The full source code of example could be
found [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-advanced-cropper-twitter-suoyc).
