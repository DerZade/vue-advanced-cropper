# Showcase

At this page you can find the examples of reimplementing existing croppers from real sites. The example
may use undocumented or unreleased features, so it's just the demonstration of the library might, not the 
guide.

If you've encountered the cropper that can't be implemented with this library, feel free to [write me](mailto:norserium@gmail.com) about it.

## Twitter

This example uses undocumented and unreleased features, it customizes default visible area generation and update visible area algorithms 
to achieve fixed / adaptive stencil behavior.
